# Learning advanced concepts in Java
:house: :computer: :coffee:

## Introduction
This is a personal project experimenting on various of concepts in Java 8 SE. 

All concepts will be categorized in packages, containing the classes that each demonstrate a topic on their own. Comments are written on code to explain further some details that might have come up from personal thought.

## Getting Started
Before diving into the material, I suggest to be familiar in [Object-Oriented Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), and its fundamental concepts in Java such as:
* Object
* Class
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism
* Abstraction
* Encapsulation
